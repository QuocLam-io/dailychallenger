              Collection of Phone Numbers
            </h2>
            <p>
              We collect your phone numbers only when you voluntarily provide
              them to us, for example, during transactions, inquiries, or when
              you sign up for our promotional messages. You can opt in to
              receive these SMS messages by providing your phone number during
              our onboarding process.

              Use of Phone Numbers for SMS

            <p>
              Your phone numbers are primarily used to provide you with
              notifications when training is due, and can be used to reply if
              you have questions about specific training materials. SMS
              messaging charges may be applied by your carrier. We will only
              share your phone number with our SMS provider, subject to their
              privacy policy.
